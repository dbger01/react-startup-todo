## 📓 AI Prompt Journal – React To‑Do App
## 🎯 Purpose
This journal documents how AI prompts were used during the development of the React + JavaScript To‑Do app. It serves as a learning record, showing how AI supported problem‑solving, debugging, and understanding of frameworks/languages.

## 🗓 Daily Prompt Log
## Day 1 – Project Setup
**Prompt**: “Explain how to set up a basic React project using Create React App.”

**AI Response Summary:** Guided step‑by‑step installation, explained folder structure, and entry point (index.js).

**Reflection**:Learned how React bootstraps apps and how components are rendered.

## Day 2 – Components & Props
**Prompt**: “Show me how to create a functional component that accepts props for a task item.”

**AI Response Summary:** Provided code snippet with TaskItem component using props.

**Reflection:** Understood how props pass data between parent and child components.

## Day 3 – State Management
**Prompt:** “How do I use useState to manage a list of tasks in React?”

**AI Response Summary:** Explained useState hook, gave example of adding/removing tasks.

**Reflection:** Learned how React re‑renders when state changes.

## Day 4 – Event Handling
**Prompt:** “Write an example of handling form input and adding a new task to state.”

**AI Response Summary:** Showed controlled components with onChange and onSubmit.

**Reflection:** Practiced handling user input and updating state correctly.

## Day 5 – Styling
**Prompt:** “Suggest simple CSS styling for a clean To‑Do list UI.”

**AI Response Summary:** Provided CSS classes for task list, buttons, and hover effects.

**Reflection:** Learned how to separate concerns between logic and presentation.

## Day 6 – Debugging
**Prompt:** “Why am I getting ‘undefined’ when accessing props in my component?”

**AI Response Summary:** Explained common mistakes (missing prop, destructuring error).

**Reflection:** Improved debugging skills by checking component hierarchy and prop names.

## Day 7 – Deployment
**Prompt:** “How do I deploy my React app to GitHub Pages?”

**AI Response Summary:** Step‑by‑step guide using gh-pages package.

**Reflection:** Learned how to make the app accessible online.

## 📌 Key Takeaways
AI helped break down complex React/JavaScript concepts into digestible steps.

Prompts acted as a learning accelerator, guiding both coding and debugging.

Documenting prompts created a transparent learning trail for future reference.
